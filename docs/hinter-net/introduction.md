![Hinter Net Social Card](../../static/img/hinter-net-social-card.jpg)

**Hinter Net** is a peer-to-peer network for collaborative intelligence, designed to scale human networking and collaboration beyond their natural limits.
By combining a secure, decentralized communication protocol with powerful AI assistance, it enables users—called **hinters**—to build high-trust, private networks.
These networks allow for sharing and contextualizing sensitive information and mapping reputation of relevant actors at a superhuman scale.

This AI-augmented networking experience is delivered through two core applications, which provide the foundational tools for you to build and leverage your own intelligence network:

- **hinter-core**: Powers the secure, peer-to-peer exchange of reports.
- **hinter-cline**: Serves as the AI-assisted command center for processing intelligence and composing reports.

# Hinter Net

**Hinter Net** is a peer-to-peer network for collaborative intelligence, designed to scale human networking and collaboration beyond its natural limits.
It combines a secure, decentralized communication protocol with AI assistance, enabling users, called **hinters**, to build high-trust, private networks for sharing and contextualizing privileged information.
Unlike public social networks, Hinter Net is quiet and private, fostering a focused environment for meaningful, high-signal exchanges with a trusted inner circle.

The project is powered by two core applications that work in tandem to create this AI-augmented networking experience.
They provide the foundational tools for you to build and leverage your own intelligence network, enhancing the way you manage relationships and information.

- **hinter-core**: The foundational P2P networking layer that handles the secure, direct exchange of reports.
- **hinter-cline**: The AI-assisted command center where you process intelligence and compose reports.

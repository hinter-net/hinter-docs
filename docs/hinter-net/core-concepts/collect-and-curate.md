# Collect and Curate Intelligence

The foundation of any effective intelligence work is a systematic approach to collecting and curating information.
In Hinter Net, your private knowledge base is your primary asset.
This is your personal, private wikiâ€”a living repository of your knowledge.

## Build Your Personal Wiki

Think of your knowledge base as a digital garden.
It's a space where you cultivate knowledge over time, a collection of interconnected notes that you can continuously edit, refine, and link together with the help of your AI assistant.

- **Create Topic-based Entries**: Create pages for people, projects, companies, or concepts that are important to you.
- **Edit and Refine**: As you learn more, update your entries. Your knowledge base should evolve with your understanding.
- **Interlink Your Notes**: Hyperlink related ideas to create a rich, contextual web of information that both you and the AI assistant can later navigate.

## Index Peer Intelligence

Your private knowledge base isn't limited to your own writings. To truly leverage your network, you should also index important or seminal reports you receive from your peers.
By cataloging these reports, you make them discoverable by your AI assistant. This allows the assistant to draw upon the collective intelligence of your network, incorporating insights from your most trusted peers into its analysis and synthesis for future tasks.

## A Foundation for Synthesis

By treating your knowledge base as a personal wiki, you create a powerful foundation for AI-driven synthesis.
When you ask your AI assistant to draft a report or summarize a topic, it can draw from a rich, interconnected set of curated documents.
The output doesn't have to be a formal Hinter Net report; the assistant can just as easily generate a draft for a regular email or a simple message based on the information it finds in your knowledge base.
